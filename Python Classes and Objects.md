# Classes and Objects

## Classes
#### A Class is a Blueprint/template of an Object, the blueprint does not ideally exist in real world.
#### Classes contain states and behavior. States are the data/variables associated with the Class, while behavior are the attributes of the Class or a set of things the Class can do.
#### For instance, the Class Person, may contain the state Name and behavior Walk. 
 
 ### Methods of a Class
  #### Are part of a Class
  #### Take parameters, modify the intenal state of an object, call other methods and functions and return values.
  #### The first parameter of a Class is ``self`` used to access the attributes of an object.


  1. For instance, a Class Person is a blueprint that you will use to create people with various attributes or behaviours.
  2. 
  
  ## Objects
  
#### So to create an object from a Class, you will need to ``instantiate`` it from the Class constructed previuosly.
#### Can be stored in a variable, which will bear the type ``class``
